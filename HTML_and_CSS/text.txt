With countless beaches to choose from on 700 islands, finding the perfect sandy spot in the Bahamas is as easy as it gets.

Pink Sand Beach on Harbour Island will wow you with its rosy hue, while The Exumas will delight you with their wild swimming pigs.

Mauritius
#6 in Best Beaches in the World for 2024
This scenic African island, which sits east of Madagascar, offers a multitude of beaches worth prioritizing. The island's west coast is where you'll find some of the best strips of shoreline, including Flic en Flac and Le Morne beaches, which feature beautiful white sand and superb vantage points for sunsets. Those who appreciate beaches near amenities will prefer north coast shores like La Cuvette, which is just removed enough from the tourist hub of Grand Baie, while those seeking a more exclusive beach experience can shell out for one of the east coast's luxury beach resorts.
